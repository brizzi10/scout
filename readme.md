Basketball Scouting Application

Web app that allows coaches/scouts to track all relevant statistics for a
specific team they are observing in real time. Detailed information for each
player will be available regarding shots taken, individual statistics, observed
traits, and plays run.

User Stories:

I want to be able to record all shots by a single player, then view them in a
useful way

The app should be incredibly easy to use, since it will be operated during a
live game

I want to record assists, rebounds, steals, and other player statistics

Player traits should be easy to add during a game

Drawing up observed plays should be intuitive, and accessing these drawings
should be equally useful

Once I have completed a game, it should be easy to update/delete the compiled
information so that it is easy to present to relevant basketball personnel

Multiple games for a singular team should be easy to access, so that a larger
range of scouting data can be compiled and processed
